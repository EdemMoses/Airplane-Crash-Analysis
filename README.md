# Aircraft Crash Analysis Using Power BI
## Overview
The Aircraft Crash Analysis project utilizes Power BI to visualize and analyze data related to airplane crashes. This project aims to provide insightful visualizations that can help in understanding the trends and factors associated with aircraft accidents from 1908 to 2023.

## Features
Data Visualization: Comprehensive dashboards created using Power BI to present data on aircraft crashes.  
Interactive Reports: Interactive elements in the reports allow users to explore data in detail.  
Trend Analysis: Visualizations to identify patterns and trends over time.  
Geographical Analysis: Maps and geographical data visualizations to pinpoint locations of crashes.  

## Project Structure
The repository is contains:  
Raw data files and datasets used for analysis.  
Power BI files for data processing, analysis, and visualization.  
PDFs contains a set of instructions and question to be answered.  
Powerpoint file containing presentation on the findings.  
README.md: Project documentation and overview.  

## Installation
